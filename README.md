# roll-dice

#### roll-dice allows the user to repeatedly click the **roll** button to run the dice animation.  Each time the dice roll, they **land** on new, randomly-generated numbers.

### roll-dice makes use of:

 - the snowfall query plugin http://www.somethinghitme.com/2011/10/05/jquery-snowfall-1-5-update-now-with-snow-buildup/
- a skier code pen by Mikolaj Szczepkowski  https://codepen.io/Mikolaj_Szczepkowski/pen/Woxrrb

I also leaned heavily on a dice-animation code pen by Tamer Aydin https://codepen.io/tameraydin/pen/CADvB to create the dice animation
